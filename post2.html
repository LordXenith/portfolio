            <h2>The Lore</h2>
            
            <p>Allina came from an alternate dimension different from ours. She wanted to meet humans in their world, but it all did not go as planned when a bug was found in her friend's portal program. Instead of going into the human realm, she can was transported into the internet browsers where any humans can find her. To test her communications skills, she asks whoever is behind the screen a number between 1 to 1000.</p>
            
            <p><img src="../assets/img/Comic.png"></p>
            
			<p>*I drew a comic on what happened to Allina </p>

            <h2> How did It start </h2>
            
            <p> So, this was actually the second homework assignment I had to do in my first Java class. I thought it would be a fun little project to implement this into JavaScript. 
                It took me almost 2-3 hours just to get some things to work. The buttons and layouts costed a lot of my time since I wanted to have a good UI, but it was a worth it. 
                I also wanted a character to guess your number just like how Akinator guesses your character, but most of the characters were licensed. I drew an original one.</p>

            <p><img src="../assets/img/model.png"></p>
            
            <h2> The Model </h2>
            <p> Translating JavaScript whilst only knowing Java was not as difficult as I thought. The only problem I had to overcome was the idea of the "browser compiler". 
                I could not figure out what went wrong with my code directly unlike the Java, where I have a JVM to compile it through GitBash.
                The code above was the model of how Allina guesses your number. It is not much because it relies on button inputs, which uses button events. 
                The code I had for Java had to deal with integer inputs based on your keyboard. </p>

            <p><img src="../assets/img/controller.png"></p>
            <h2> The Controller </h2>
            <p> Above is the controller JavaScript source code. Allina needs to get an idea on what you are saying. Just talking to the screen would not let her hear you. Pressing buttons gives Allina the signal to determine the number you are thinking of. </p>
