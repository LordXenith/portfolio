            <h2>The Original Plan</h2>
            
            <p>I grew up in Louisiana and moved around to many states like Iowa, Washington State, and now Texas. I never knew what I wanted to do in life.
                I was one of those students that only did good in school because I felt it was an obligation for my family. I had many of my family members try to convince me
                to become a doctor or a pharmacist. I learned the hard way that it takes a lot of time and effort in school to become a doctor and I was not sure if 
                I was going to like it. My aunt is a pharmacist and she was still dealing with student loans even after getting her masters degree. This intimidated me since during my time in school.
            </p>
            
            <p><img src="../assets/img/lightbulb.png"></p>

            <h2>The Light Bulb</h2>
            
            <p>So after some time with my family on talking about career plans, my father told me about computer science. 
                My parents never completed high school and they never experienced a college education. During this time, I was attending high school in 
                Louisiana. I looked into computer science and I was ignorant. I did not realize that there was a program like this existed, especially
                at the university that I attended. So I decided to give it a shot and this was what I wanted to do.
                
            </p>

            <p><img src="../assets/img/multitask.png"></p>
            
            <h2>The Greed</h2>
            <p>During my time attending the University of New Orleans, I was so passionate on attending courses. I had a full ride, I wanted to know how to program.
                I saw a couple of my classmates taking different fields like cyber security, AI, game dev, and etc. I wanted to do them all. I was so interested in 
                everything that in the end, I never chose a concentration. If I was able to go back in time to change something about myself, it is to not be greedy and 
                choose a concentration. Maybe then, I would have got many internships.
            </p>

            <h2>The Result </h2>
            <p>Fast forward to the present (as of making this in January 2024), I am a desktop support attempting to get back into my original career into software development.
                I am going to attempt to get certifications to make up the lack of experience and make myself stand out among the sea of resumes. I want to build and grow professionally.
                Therefore, I will do more LeetCode, freeCodeCamp, and The Odin Project.
